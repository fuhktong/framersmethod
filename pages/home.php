            The Framers' Method can restore political stability to the

            Caucus, the Hamilton Method, and the Electors' Convention, we can
            restore the sovereignty of the American people.

                    With our open primary system, tyrannically-mined candidates may
                    take over one of the two major parties. They can then use
                    populist rhetoric to influence and control the American people.
                    More often than not, this rhetoric is a distraction from the
                    public good.

                    By eliminating the centralized national election system and
                    replacing it with local elections, the American people can
                    defeat populism and tyranny. Democratic systems often produce
                    demagogues, but their powers of populist rhetoric on the
                    national stage are diminished when local elections are used.
