                Whatever you think about the Electoral College, it is not of the
                framers' design. Diving deep into the realm of political science,
                the reader will discover what the framers actually created, how
                truly different the framers' Electoral College is from our modern
                incarnation, and reforms that will bring us back to the framers'
                original concept of choosing a president.
                <br />
                Using original analysis and data, The Framers' Method describes how
                the delegates to the constitutional convention built a system of
                decentralization and deliberation to elect a president. By
                dispersing power to electors throughout the several states to
                nominate candidates, "designing men" would be unable to influence
                and control the masses. By returning to the framers' method, we can
                save the United States from the destructiveness of populism and
                tyranny.
