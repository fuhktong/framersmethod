            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <h1>Proportional Representation with a Touch of Competition</h1>
            <p>
                The Hamilton Method splits up electors by first giving each party
                the whole number of reps they should get based on the votes they
                received. Then, any leftover seats go to the party or parties with
                the largest remainder.

            <h2>The Hamilton Method</h2>
            <h1>
                A decentralized election system will prevent national populist
                rhetoric.
            </h1>
            <p>
                With thousands of possible electors, political influence is
                dispersed throughout the country. No elector candidate will wield
                concentrated power on the national stage. Money in politics, media
                influence, and foreign intelligence services will have little
                influence on the electoral process.

            <h1>Key Points of the Hamilton Method:</h1>
            <p>• Elections are local within each state</p>
            <p>• The national election is eliminated</p>
            <p>• Populism and tyranny are ineffective</p>
            <p>
                • Money is still used for campaigning, but will be decentralized
            </p>
            <p>
                • Thousands of potential electors prevent influence by foreign
                intelligence services as well as traditional media and social
                media
