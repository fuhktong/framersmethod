            <p>
                A democracy is a form of government in which the people directly
                determine the rules. In contrast, a republic is a system where the
                people elect a smaller group of representatives to create the
                rules on their behalf.
            </p>
            <p>
                In regards to the Electoral College, the small group of
                representatives would be electors and these electors would choose
                the president on behalf of the people.
