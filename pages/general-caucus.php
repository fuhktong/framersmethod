            <h1>The General Caucus</h1>
            <h2>
                A new election system designed to<br />
                defeat tyranny and oligarchy.
            </h2>
            <p>
                The General Caucus is a series of tiered meetings for selecting
                politicians to specific offices, beginning at the precinct level
                where registered voters gather to choose delegates for the
                following caucus. At each precinct caucus, attendees debate
                relevant issues and group themselves with a potential delegate
                until one group achieves a simple majority. All office holders
                must come from the caucuses. State legislature districts are used
                because they are designed based on roughly equal population size.
            </p>
            <p>
                Precinct caucuses will select all delegates for governor, senator,
                etc., but the following caucuses will be separated depending on
                the office. There may be a final statewide caucus, i.e. governor
                or senator, but they can also have regional caucuses, i.e.
                representative or elector. Ideally, discussions will focus on
                issues relevant to the specific office being filled such as local
                matters for mayoral selections, federal issues for senatorial
                choices, and so forth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, the general caucus is a system that defends the people
                from the perverse interests of the oligarchs and the populist
                rhetoric of tyrannically-minded candidates.

            <h2>
                The General Caucus does not require<br />
                money to operate.
            </h2>
            <p>
                The General Caucus is a series of meetings by caucus-goers and
                delegates which does not need money to operate. There are no
                individual campaigns that need vast sums of money to sway voters
                with campaign commercials. It's not an election, it's a caucus!
                It's free! What a great idea!

            <h2>
                All office holders must come<br />
                from the General Caucus.
            </h2>
            <p>
                The influence of the parties is severely reduced. Any potential
                office holder is required to pass through the precinct caucus,
                state legislature district caucus, and the final statewide
                caucus. Even if parties nominate a candidate, that nominee must
                attend and be chosen at all three caucuses.

            <h1>Media Influence is Mitigated</h1>
            <h2>Mass Media and Social Media Has Minimal Effect</h2>
            <p>
                With the General Caucus, there are millions of people involved at
                the precinct level with thousands of potential delegates to the
                state legislature district caucus. Both legacy and social media
                are not able to concentrate their power on any particular
                candidates with so many people involved in the process.
            </p>
            <p>
                This will increase voter independence as voters engage directly
                with each other rather than being manipulated by media narratives.
                So much of the media's influence revolves around very base issues
                and usually prioritizes sensationalism over substance.
