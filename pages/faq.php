            The Constitution determines that each state shall decide how
            electors are chosen. However, in practice, two groups elect the
            members of the Electoral College. First, parties within each state
            will choose their slate of electors. Depending on the state, these
            slates of electors may be chosen through a party convention, from
            the state's central committee, or from the presidential campaign
            itself.

            electors' convention method, and the popular vote. The framers ended
            up compromising by creating a hybrid method of the legislature and
            electors' convention methods. The popular vote was highly unpopular
            with the framers at the Constitutional Convention.

            The members of the Electoral College, also known as electors, are
            chosen in two steps. First, the political parties of the
            presidential candidates will choose slates of electors through a
            party convention, by a party's state central committee, or by the
            presidential campaign itself. Then, whichever presidential candidate
            wins a state's popular vote will determine which slate of electors
            will be able to vote for president.

        <p class="faq-p">
            The Electoral College is necessary to choose the president because

            The Electoral College used today works by candidates competing to
            win the popular vote in individual states to win each state's
            respective electoral votes. Whichever candidate receives 270 or more
            electoral votes will win the presidential election.

            Electoral votes are determined by the number of representatives each
            state has been allotted in the House of Representatives plus its two
            senators. For example, Michigan has 13 representatives and 2
            senators, giving them a total of 15 electors.

            Yes, electors of the Electoral College can vote differently from the

            past elections because the criteria may be different for counting
            faithless electors. That being said, faithless electors have never
            overturned a presidential election.

            The Electoral College is a very controversial institution, so the
            pros and cons may differ from person to person. However, broadly
            speaking, an often-cited advantage is that presidential candidates
            must win states throughout the country, for example, more rural
            states, instead of population centers. The most often disadvantage
            discussed is that the candidate with the most votes does not
            determine the winner.
