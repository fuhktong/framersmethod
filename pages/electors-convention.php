            <h1>An Electors' Convention</h1>
            <h2>
                Deliberation will give America the president it needs for the
                future.
            </h2>
            <p>
                After the several states choose their electors, an electors'
                convention will choose the next president. In this environment,
                populism and tyranny are impossible. To become the next president
                one of the electors will need the skills of negotiation and
                compromise.

            <h1>No Majority</h1>
            <h2>Without a majority party, electors must deliberate.</h2>
            <p>
                When the electors assemble at the seat of government, the Hamilton
                Method will have prevented any party from achieving a majority
                electoral vote. Electors will be forced into deliberation. One of
                the electors must be able to build a coalition of 270 electors to
                be chosen as the next president.
