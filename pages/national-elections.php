                Concentrated interests undermine the will of the people and pursue
                interests against the public good. The people have become divided
                while the oligarchs exploit the system and tyrants destabilize the
                country with populist rhetoric. Parties, money, and the media are
                the base of infleunce in our elections.

            <h1>Political Parties</h1>
            <h2>The two parties do not give voters a real choice.</h2>
            <p>
                In the nominating primaries, very few voters turn out to vote and
                the party's nominee is determined after only a few contests.
                Voters in primaries tend to be more ideologically extreme,
                equating to more extreme nominees. After the primaries, parties
                present their nominees to the general electorate. With the
                two-party system, there are only two options. There isn't a real
                choice for voters.

            <h1>Money in Politics</h1>
            <h2>
                The amount of money in politics delegitimizes the electoral
                process.
            </h2>
            <p>
                *Over 1.8 billion dollars was raised in the 2024 presidential
                election and over 15.9 billion dollars was spent on all federal
                elections. The outsized role of money undermines the democratic
                principle of equal representation, as wealthy donors and special
                interest groups gain disproportionate access to candidates and
                policymakers. This leads to policies that favor a few over the
                many and erodes public trust in government institutions. Moreover,
                the perpetual need for fundraising distracts elected officials
                from their duties, further entrenching inequality and prioritizing
                monetary interests over the public good.

            <h1>Media Influence is Destroying America</h1>
            <h2>
                Legacy Media and Social Media have perpetuated fear and turned
                Americans against each another.
            </h2>
            <p>
                The media plays the most destructive role as various outlets play
                on fear for ratings. Different channels take ideological sides
                resulting in the promotion of their preferred candidates and the
                demonization of the opposition candidate. Topics in the media
                rarely discuss issues of the public good and mostly focus on the
                horse-race between the candidates.
            </p>
            <p>
                Social media has become a cess pool of misinformation and
                conspiracy theories. Most often, no one knows the source of
                disinformation campaigns, whether they be foreign intelligence
                operations or disturbed individuals.

                National elections concentrate the political power of our country
                into the hands of two people. And money and the media have an
                oversized influence on these two people. The framers feared
                national elections and so should we.
