            <p>
              The General Caucus is a series of tiered meetings for selecting
              politicians to specific offices, beginning at the precinct level
              where registered voters gather to choose delegates for the
              following caucus. At each precinct caucus, attendees debate
              relevant issues and group themselves with a potential delegate
              until one group achieves a simple majority. All office holders
              selected must come from the caucuses. State legislature districts
              are used because they are designed based on roughly equal
              population size.
            </p>
            <p>
              Precinct caucuses will select all delegates for governor, senator,
              etc. but the following caucuses will be separated depending on the
              office. There may be a final state-wide caucus, i.e. governor or
              senator, but can also have regional caucuses, i.e. representative
              or elector. Ideally discussions will focus on issues relevant to
              the specific office being filled such as local matters for mayoral
              selections, federal issues for senatorial choices, and so forth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ultimately, the general caucus is a system that defends the people
              from perverse interests of the oligarchs and the populist rhetoric
              of tyrannically-minded candidates.{" "}

              The General Caucus is a series of meetings by caucus-goers and
              delegates which does not need money to operate. There are no
              individual camapigns that need vast sums of money to sway voters
              with campaign commercials. It's not an election, it's a caucus!
              It's free! What a great idea!{" "}

              The influence of the parties is severaly reduced. Any potential
              office holder is required to pass through the precinct caucus,
              state legislature district caucus, and the final state-wide
              caucus. Even if parties nominate a candidate, that nominee must
              attend and be chosen at all three caucuses.{" "}

            <h1>Media Influence is Mitigated</h1>
            <h2>Mass Media and Social Media Has Minimal Effect</h2>
            <p>
              With the General Caucus, there are millions of people involved at
              the precinct level with thousands of potential delegates to the
              state legislature district caucus. Both the legacy and social
              media are not able to concentrate their power on any particular
              candidates with so many people involved in the process.
            </p>
            <p>
              This will increase voter independence as voters engage directly
              with each other rather than being manipulated by media narratives.
              So much of the media’s influence revolves around very base issues
              and usually prioritizes sensationalism over substance.{" "}
